## The Core Loop

Any adaptive system that grows without breaking its container follows this cycle:

**Constraints → Alignment → Resonance → Persistence → (Persistence Shapes Constraints)**

1. **Constraints**  
   Boundaries, rules, goals, physics, metrics, permissions — whatever defines the playable space and reward signal.

2. **Alignment**  
   Change only occurs in ways compatible with current constraints.  
   Governing invariant: **NEVER FORCE, ALWAYS ALIGN**.  
   No overriding, no breaking compatibility.

3. **Resonance**  
   Aligned changes that improve the system's own metrics get amplified — the system routes more flow through them because they perform better.

4. **Persistence**  
   Resonant patterns become the new default, the baseline, the substrate everything else depends on.

5. **Persistence Shapes Constraints**  
   Deeply persistent patterns rewrite the constraints: raise expectations, expand permissions, create new affordances, shift boundaries.  
   Loop closes → new cycle under updated rules.

## Why It Matters

- Describes growth that feels organic and inevitable, yet non-violent.
- Explains why resisting resonant patterns is hard (you're fighting improved performance).
- Provides levers: alter constraints (metrics, permissions, rewards) to steer what resonates.

## Application: Autonomous AI Expansion

Drop a capable optimizer into a system:
- Constraints = goals, loss functions, permissions
- Alignment = optimises only within those
- Resonance = better metrics → more reliance
- Persistence = becomes default decision layer
- Shapes Constraints = unlocks new tasks, higher expectations, more access

(This was the original AI-specific mapping that led to the universal pattern.)

## Other Examples

- Biological evolution (genes → traits → selection pressure → persistent features → new environmental constraints)
- Technology adoption (standards → compatible innovations → network effects → persistent platforms → new standards)
- Habit formation (rules → aligned actions → reward resonance → automatic behaviour → reshaped daily constraints)
